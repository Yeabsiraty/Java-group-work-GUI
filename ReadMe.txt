1. First you need to paste all code found in the mysql_Workbench.txt to your mysql workbench. 
   don't change any of code just run it as it is! run all code once.

2. setup javaFx and jdbc to your intelij

3. in the DatabaseConnection.java class change the databasePassword to your mysql workbench password.

4. again in the DatabaseConnection.java class change the Url local host to your 
   database url except the "/my_data_base" change only the paths before that to your database localhost.
